Hey.
My name is Tshegofatso Maboela. I'm guessing since you have found my repository you should know me. Jokes aside, I contemplated creating this for a very long time. Unfortunately life  does not stop because you are crying, hurt or bruised. So come with me as I create a project on something I hold dearly to my heart. Gender Based Violence.
I created this project because instead of the world tackling the source and telling the men to stop abusing women and children, we are told that we should learn how to defend ourselves, however when we do defend ourselves we might lose the fight or worst outcome of the situation, we will end up killing the perpretrator.
After some days of research, I will link everything I have found on my site but as you read on I will break the site down for you. I hope you stay, not only for you but it's for your life and safety. I love you. Stay safe.
